PirottaNicola: based on my pom, which is the best docker image to use to dockerize my springboot application?

Workspace: Collecting workspace informationBased on your pom.xml, your Spring Boot application uses Java 21, Spring Boot 3.4.5, and includes dependencies for Spring Data JPA, Spring Security, H2 Database, and JWT. The best Docker base image for your application would be one that supports Java 21 and is optimized for Spring Boot applications.

Here’s the recommended base image:

```dockerfile
FROM eclipse-temurin:21-jdk-alpine
```

### Why this image?

1. **Java 21 Support**: The `eclipse-temurin:21-jdk-alpine` image provides a lightweight JDK 21 runtime.
2. **Alpine Base**: The Alpine variant is small, reducing the overall image size.
3. **Compatibility**: It works well with Spring Boot applications.

### Alternative

If you prefer an image specifically tailored for Spring Boot:

```dockerfile
FROM amazoncorretto:21-alpine
```

This is another lightweight and production-ready JDK 21 image.

### Complete Example Dockerfile

Here’s how you can structure your Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
# Use a lightweight JDK 21 image
FROM eclipse-temurin:21-jdk-alpine

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the built JAR file into the container
COPY target/ripasso-spring-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar app.jar

# Expose the application port
EXPOSE 8080

# Run the Spring Boot application
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
```

### Steps to Build and Run

1. **Build the JAR**:
   ```sh
   ./mvnw clean package
   ```
2. **Build the Docker Image**:
   ```sh
   docker build -t ripasso-spring .
   ```
3. **Run the Container**:
   ```sh
   docker run -p 8080:8080 ripasso-spring
   ```

PirottaNicola: @workspace What about multi-stage builds?

Workspace: Collecting workspace informationUsing a multi-stage build for your Dockerfile can help reduce the final image size by separating the build environment from the runtime environment. This is especially useful for Java applications, as you can use a Maven image to build the JAR and then copy the resulting artifact into a lightweight runtime image.

Here’s how you can modify your Dockerfile to use a multi-stage build:

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build the application
FROM maven:3.9.9-eclipse-temurin-21 AS build

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the Maven wrapper and pom.xml
COPY pom.xml mvnw ./
COPY .mvn .mvn

# Download dependencies
RUN ./mvnw dependency:go-offline

# Copy the source code
COPY src ./src

# Build the application
RUN ./mvnw clean package -DskipTests

# Stage 2: Create the runtime image
FROM eclipse-temurin:21-jdk-alpine

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the built JAR file from the build stage
COPY --from=build /app/target/ripasso-spring-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar app.jar

# Expose the application port
EXPOSE 8080

# Run the Spring Boot application
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
```

### Explanation:

1. **Stage 1: Build Stage**:

   - Uses the `maven:3.9.9-eclipse-temurin-21` image to build the application.
   - Copies the pom.xml, .mvn folder, and source code into the container.
   - Runs the Maven build process to produce the JAR file.

2. **Stage 2: Runtime Stage**:
   - Uses the lightweight `eclipse-temurin:21-jdk-alpine` image for running the application.
   - Copies only the built JAR file from the build stage, keeping the runtime image clean and small.

### Benefits:

- **Smaller Final Image**: The runtime image does not include Maven or source code, reducing its size.
- **Clean Separation**: The build tools and dependencies are isolated from the runtime environment.
- **Reproducibility**: Ensures a consistent build process within the container.

### Build and Run:

1. **Build the Docker Image**:
   ```sh
   docker build -t ripasso-spring .
   ```
2. **Run the Container**:
   ```sh
   docker run -p 8080:8080 ripasso-spring
   ```
